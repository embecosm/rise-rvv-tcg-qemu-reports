# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-12-04

## Milestone 2

Make requested revisions to Paolo's upstream patches.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- This work is now being handled by Craig Blackmore.
- We have a reworked version of the first patch, which addresses the issue of whether an exception  during the load/store could lead to an invalid value in the `vstart` CSR (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-11/msg03037.html)). Benchmarking shows an improvement in performance for small vectors. The patch has been submitted (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-riscv/2024-12/msg00080.html)).
  - Max has replied suggesting this still does not resolve the `vstart` issue (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-12/msg00812.html)).  We are investigating this.  We are calling the correct atomic functions, but it seems we are not setting the flag to specify the atomicity.
- For the second patch, we are exploring a possible solution to ensure that interrupts are not taken in the middle of an element during `memcpy` (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-11/msg03111.html)).  We have identified the functions we will be using to resolve this.

SiFive benchmarks.
- **COMPLETE**.

## Milestone 3

Generate TCG Ops for vector load/store.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- We have a working implementation of the TCG operations generation for the whole register loads/stores.  This still needs to be made safe for atomicity and needs further testing to ensure its full correctness and maximum efficiency with different element size and `VLEN`.  The current implementation is only for whole vector loads and stores (which do not form part of the SiFive benchmark suite). The implementation uses the generic TCG vector op generation.  We are now working on generating x86 vector specific operations to allow us to handle up to 256 bits at a time and handling generic vector loads and stores.

Improve first-fault handling for vector load/store helper functions.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- No new work to report this week.

Improve strided load/store helper functions.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- No new work to report this week.

## Statistics

### SiFive benchmarks: Patch 1 comparison

- Baseline commit: [248f9209ed](https://github.com/craigblackmore/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/commit/248f9209edfd289e7d97fb323e5075ccd55cc157)
- Patch commit: [c55fb34cbf](https://github.com/craigblackmore/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/commit/c55fb34cbfc225dd61d8b8bbeb1be4b813bfb9d7)
- See [report-2024-12-03-21-47-51.pdf](./strmem-reports/report-2024-12-03-21-47-51.pdf).

The benefit cannot be seen on the graphs, because it is all in the small sizes, but is clear in the detailed results.  For `memcpy` with `VLEN=128`, we see more than 20% improvement on small data and for `VLEN=1024`, more than 25% improvement.

We note that the speedup is very size dependent.  Why is there a substantial speedup with `memcpy` for all data sizes 1-8 bytes except 7 bytes.  Consistently across runs.  We'll do some single instruction benchmarking to try to characterize this.

## Actions

2024-11-13:
- Craig Blackmore (transferred from Paolo Savini) to investigate whether patch #1 may cause exceptions to be taken at the wrong byte address, thereby causing a failure on resumption.
  - **ONGOING**.
  - Updated patch benchmarked and submitted. Revision to specify the atomicity for the atomic functions under development.
- Craig Blackmore (transferred from Paolo Savini) to investigate whether patch #2 can use larger `memcpy` than Max and therefore may offer further improvements.
  - **ONGOING**.
  - Functions to use identified.
