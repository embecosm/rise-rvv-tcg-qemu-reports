# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-06-13

## Meetings will be on a fortnightly basis from now on. Next meeting will be on June 19th.

# Overview

## Introducing the project team
- Paolo Savini (Embecosm)
- Helene Chelin (Embecosm)
- Jeremy Bennett (Embecosm)
- Hugh O'Keeffe (Ashling)
- Nadim Shehayed (Ashling)
- Daniel Barboza (Ventana)

## Work completed since last report

- WP2:
  - Get SPECCPU results the optimization of the vle8.v instruction.
    - **IN PROGRESS**: some tests show a little improvement but a few tests fail. We're investigating.
    - We fixed a bug appearing when increasing the data size and VLEN above 512 bytes with LMUL 8.
  - Optimize the tail bytes of vle8.v.
    - Deferred.
  - Add optimization for vse8.v.
    - The optimization was extended to support stores too. See below.
  - Explore optimization through the usage of builtins like `__builtin_memcpy`.
    - bswap.h contains already examples of this and a useful pool of functions for simd stores and loads.
    - we are trying to see if we can optimize 64 bit vle/vse and by extension the others with 128 bit operations.
  - We started setting up the infrastructure to work on ARM.

## Work planned for the coming week

- WP2:
  - Get SPECCPU results the optimization of the vle8.v/vse8.v instruction.
    - Triage the remaining failures.
  - Optimize the tail bytes of vle8.v.
  - Experiment the 128 bit optimization.

## Current priorties

Our current set of agreed priorities are taken from the Statement of Work.
This has the following priorities, which trade off functionality targeted versus architectures supported.

- vector load/store ops for x86_64 AVX
- vector load/store ops for AArch64/Neon
- vector integer ALU ops for x86_64 AVX
- vector load/store ops for Intel AVX10

For each of these there will be an analysis phase and an optimization phase, leading to the following set of work packages.
- WP0: Infrastructure
- WP1: Analysis of vector load/store ops on x86_64 AVX
- WP2: Optimization of vector load/store ops on x86_64 AVX
- WP3: Analysis of vector load/store ops on AArch64/Neon
- WP4: Optimization of vector load/store ops on AArch64/Neon
- WP5: Analysis of integer ALU ops on x86_64 AVX
- WP6: Optimization of integer ALU ops on x86_64 AVX
- WP7: Analysis of vector load/store ops on Intel AVX10
- WP8: Optimization of vector load/store ops on Intel AVX10

These priorities can be revised by agreement with RISE during the project.

# Detailed description of work

## WP2: Optimization of vle8.v

We pushed a pull request to Embecosm's public repo with the changes made so far to optimize the `vle*.v`/`vse*.v` instructions:

https://github.com/embecosm/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/pull/1/files

The pull request contains the initial implementation plus the later addition of the extra function pointer used to select the right double word load or store function to speed up the current load/store instruction in the `vext_ldst_us` helper function.

```
GEN_VEXT_LD_US(vle8_v,  int8_t,  lde_b, lde_d)
GEN_VEXT_LD_US(vle16_v, int16_t, lde_h, lde_d)
GEN_VEXT_LD_US(vle32_v, int32_t, lde_w, lde_d)
GEN_VEXT_LD_US(vle64_v, int64_t, lde_d, lde_d)

...

GEN_VEXT_ST_US(vse8_v,  int8_t,  ste_b, ste_d)
GEN_VEXT_ST_US(vse16_v, int16_t, ste_h, ste_d)
GEN_VEXT_ST_US(vse32_v, int32_t, ste_w, ste_d)
GEN_VEXT_ST_US(vse64_v, int64_t, ste_d, ste_d)
```
The pull request also contains a fix to the management of the loop indexes that solves the segmentation fault issue we were having with large data sizes.

This doesn't have an impact on the performance but only on the correctness.
We added some correctness checks to the memcpy benchmarks (check that the contents of the destination register and source register coincide) and all the tests now pass.
The next steps involve try to optimize beyond 64 bits and extend this optimization to other load/store helper functions.

# Statistics

## Individual RVV instruction performance

These results are in ns/instruction.

No changes to the results as the latest patch achieves correctness rather then performance.

## SPEC CPU 2017 performance

We haven't been able to collect all the results we need with SPECCPU and what we have so far will need more analysis but you can see the progress [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16tDLHZad6gN8h0-Echc87fzcO9Oro-kzWl01qFhQZjA/edit?usp=sharing)
