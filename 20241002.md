# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-10-02

## Work completed since last report

[SiFive function performance report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i6RLfZISECriwIesDVeZ9x1TjZHoOO5w).

- WP2
  - Complete SiFive library function set
    - added `strcat`.
    - work in progress on the remaining 8 functions.
  - Single instruction benchmarking relevant to SiFive library functions
    - on hold.
  - Resume work on AArch64 comparison.
    - working on the single instruction comparison between a Aarch64 vector load and vle8.v.
    - on hold to prioritize the separation of the patches.

- Other
  - Separate Embecosm's and Max's patches:
    - work in progress. This is a substantial effort because all the changes since July have been assumed to build on Max's work, and hence we need to write code to allow the patch to work standalone.
  - Updated small load/store loop optimization upstream with user mode condition.

## Work planned for the coming week

- WP2
  - Complete SiFive library function set.
  - Continue to work on the separation of the large load/store patch.
  - Single instruction benchmarking relevant to SiFive library functions.
  - Continue to work on AArch64 comparison.

## Changes since start of project

It is useful to keep an idea of what we have achieved since 1 May 2024. We use ns/instruction as our metric.

| Metric                  | Start |  Now | Speedup | Notes        |
|:------------------------|------:|-----:|--------:|:-------------|
| `memcpy` worst case     |       |      |      2% |              |
| `memcpy` best case      |       |      |  6,869% |              |
| SPEC CPU 2017 average   |  13.3 | 11.3 |     15% |              |
| SPEC CPU 2017 best case |  12.0 |  7.4 |     38% | `628.pop2_s` |

Percentage changes relative to "now".  SPEC CPU 2017 results are from August, since we have stopped measuring this.
