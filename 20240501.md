# QEMU TCG RVV optimization: Weekly report 2024-05-01

This week is our initial kick-off meeting.

# Overview

## Introducing the project team
- Paolo Savini (Embecosm)
- Helene Chelin (Embecosm)
- Jeremy Bennett (Embecosm)
- Hugh O'Keeffe (Ashling)

## Work completed since last report

Nothing this week, but we'll report in future weeks against the previous week's planned activities.

## Work planned for the coming week

- WP1:
  - Pull together all the memory/string operations benchmarks and obtain baseline QEMU instruction counts.
  - Establish framework for single RVV instruction benchmarks and obtain example performance scores.
  - Obtain reference QEMU SPEC CPU 2017 instruction count baselines with and without RVV.
    - decide on whether to enable any other ISA extensions (e.g. Zvfh/Zfh) and whether to use LTO.

# Detailed description of work

## Proposed priorties

The Statement of Work proposes the following priorities, which trade off functionality targeted versus architectures supported.

- vector load/store ops for x86_64 AVX
- vector load/store ops for AArch64/Neon
- vector integer ALU ops for x86_64 AVX
- vector load/store ops for Intel AVX10

For each of these there will be an analysis phase and an optimization phase, leading to the following set of work packages.
- WP0: Infrastructure
- WP1: Analysis of vector load/store ops on x86_64 AVX
- WP2: Optimization of vector load/store ops on x86_64 AVX
- WP3: Analysis of vector load/store ops on AArch64/Neon
- WP4: Optimization of vector load/store ops on AArch64/Neon
- WP5: Analysis of integer ALU ops on x86_64 AVX
- WP6: Optimization of integer ALU ops on x86_64 AVX
- WP7: Analysis of vector load/store ops on Intel AVX10
- WP8: Optimization of vector load/store ops on Intel AVX10

These priorities can be revised by agreement with RISE during the project.

## WP0: Initial setup and admin

### Compiler tool chains

We will generally use GCC from the pre-built RISC-V tool chains from the Embecosm website [download page](https://www.embecosm.com/resources/tool-chain-downloads/#riscv-linux).  Where we need to use the most up-to-date compiler, we will build our own tool Linux tool chain using the same scripts as the Embecosm website.

### SPEC CPU 2017

We have SPECCPU 2017 installed and routinely measure performance in-house.  In future weeks we will publish the QEMU instruction count results in this report.  However given the time it takes to complete a fun with vector enabled, we do not anticipate updating the full results every week.

### QEMU

We have a public fork of the official QEMU github mirror, which we will use as a staging post for our development work pending submission upstream.

# Statistics

This week we show only the section headings.  In future weeks we shall report statistics here, in most cases showing deltas against the previous results.

## Memory/string operations
## Individual RVV instruction performance
## SPEC CPU 2017 performance

SPEC CPU 2017 is designed to be reported using timings.  We have found it clearest to report QEMU instruction counts as though they were from a machine executing 10^9 instructions per second.  Then all the standard SPEC CPU scripts work seamlessly.

# Actions

# Risk register

For each risk, we report the impact of it happening on the project (1 (minimal), 2 (serious) or 3 (project killer) and the likelihood of it occuring (from 1 - 10).  Where the impact is 3, or where the product of impact and likelihood is > 10, we propose a mitigation strategy.

The risk register is held in a shared spreadsheet.  We will keep it updated continuously and report any changes each week.

# Planned absences

Helene will be on vacation from the 1st to the 12th of May.
