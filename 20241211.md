# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-12-11

## Milestone 2

Make requested revisions to Paolo's upstream patches.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- This work is now being handled by Craig Blackmore.
- We have a further reworked version of the first patch, which addresses the issue of whether an exception during the load/store could lead to an invalid value in the `vstart` CSR (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-11/msg03037.html)) and also the issue raised by Max Chou (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-12/msg00812.html)).  This is now posted upstream (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-12/msg02265.html)).  See the detailed discussion below.
- The second patch, has been rewritten to address the issue raised in [this mailing list post](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-11/msg03111.html).  We do not think our approach is optimal and have posted a RFQ upstream asking for advice (see [this mailing list post](https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-12/msg02274.html)).  Detailed discussion below.

SiFive benchmarks.
- **COMPLETE**.

### Patch 1 details

Making the accesses atomic didn't help in the end as `vstart` does need to point to the exact element on which the trap was taken. We've updated the patch to only access up to element size. The new version bypasses a simple call out to `memcpy`, instead doing single byte accesses with a lot more indirection/instructions executed.

However, benchmarking the SiFive `memcpy` suggests the patch is improving performance for length < 12 bytes. This version of the patch, pending submission upstream is commit [1c035a7319](https://github.com/craigblackmore/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/commit/1c035a73191d156b765994853aab4f95520d26cb) in Craig Blackmore's QEMU fork.

We also experimented with avoiding the `memcpy` directly in `vext_continuos_ldst_host` for < 12 bytes and instead doing `ldst_host` for each element.  However that was less beneficial.

### Patch 2 details

The current version of the patch is on GitHub commit [8229b8e308](https://github.com/craigblackmore/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/commit/8229b8e3080dbb2f3b793014e7d78615781b8152) in Craig Blackmore's QEMU fork.

The code is rewritten using atomic load/stores. Now using 2, 4, 8 or 16 byte accesses if there are enough elements (the previous version only used 16 byte accesses). The patch uses functions provided by `accel/tcg/ldst_atomicity.c.inc`. The way we get at them from the riscv target is a bit dirty.  Craig Blackmore has posted to seek advice on how better to do this.

**Note.** The SiFive benchmarks only use 1 byte element size insns `vle8`/`vse8` so they won't show the benefit from this patch.  Jeremy Bennett will create alternative benchmarks to measure the impact.

## Milestone 3

Generate TCG Ops for vector whole word load/store.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- We have benchmarked TCG operations generation for the whole register loads/stores using a modified version of vector memcpy. For VLEN=128 this almost doubles performance for the very smallest data sizes (1, 2 bytes), while yielding nearly treble performance for larger data sizes.  For VLEN=1024 the speedup ranges from 50% for the very smallest data sizes to 2.5-fold for larger data. The work is in commit [e473afe818](https://github.com/PaoloS02/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/commit/e473afe818c283a311cef27412b4985cbf27fb5e) in Palo Savini's QEMU fork.
- We are currently cleaning up the patch, particularly to ensure that the stat of the CPU is always consistent with RISC-V semantics with respect to the `vstart` CSR (this may reduce the performance).  We will submit this upstream shortly when this work is complete.

Improve first-fault handling for vector load/store helper functions.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- No new work to report this week.

Improve strided load/store helper functions.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- No new work to report this week.

## Statistics

### SiFive benchmarks: Patch 1 comparison

- Baseline commit: [248f9209ed](https://github.com/craigblackmore/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/commit/248f9209edfd289e7d97fb323e5075ccd55cc157)
- Patch commit: [9e5145d045](https://github.com/craigblackmore/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/commit/9e5145d0453481c8df9047ba8dc86919a757565d)
- See [report-2024-12-05-16-41-57.pdf](./strmem-reports/report-2024-12-05-16-41-57.pdf).

As noted above, there is a performance benefit of up to 30% for `memcpy` with small data.  This is hard to see in the graphs, but is clear in the detailed results.

### TCGOp generation for memcpy (modified)

- Baseline commit: [25fdf6a6ec](https://github.com/PaoloS02/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/commit/25fdf6a6ec365cdd11ed9c5ca299360ce6f96ae0)
- Patch commit: [e473afe818](https://github.com/PaoloS02/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/commit/e473afe818c283a311cef27412b4985cbf27fb5e)
- See [report-2024-12-09-09-33-28.pdf](./strmem-reports/report-2024-12-09-09-33-28.pdf).

This is a version of the SiFive `memcpy` benchmark modified to use whole word load/store.

## Actions

2024-11-13:
- Craig Blackmore (transferred from Paolo Savini) to investigate whether patch #1 may cause exceptions to be taken at the wrong byte address, thereby causing a failure on resumption.
  - **COMPLETE**.
  - Updated patch benchmarked and submitted.
- Craig Blackmore (transferred from Paolo Savini) to investigate whether patch #2 can use larger `memcpy` than Max and therefore may offer further improvements.
  - **ONGOING**.
  - RFQ posted to improve initial implementation.

## Other

Jeremy Bennett, Craig Blackmore and Paolo Savini will be on vacation 23 December to 3 January.

Next meeting 18 December 2024.
