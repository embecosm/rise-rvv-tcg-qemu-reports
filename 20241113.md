# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-11-13

Updated afer report with corrections and actions.

## Milestone 2

Make requested revisions to Paolo's upstream patches:
- COMPLETE.
- first patch submitted with changes recommended by Daniel Barboza, awaiting merge.
- second patch made obsolete by merge of Max's V6 patch:
  - this incorporates the use of memcpy; and
  - we have asked for clarification from Richard Henderson of why atomicity matters for the memcpy call.

SiFive benchmarks:
- COMPLETE.
- the two previously reported failing benchmarks (`strlen` and `strncmp`) are due to attempting to explore values of LMUL that are not supported.

## Milestone 3

Generate TCG Ops for vector load/store
- IN PROGRESS.

Improve first-fault handling for vector load/store helper functions.
- NOT STARTED.
- Work is affected by Max's version 6 patch.

Improve strided load/store helper functions.
- NOT STARTED.

## Statistics

### SiFive benchmarks

**Note.** Max's V6 patch now merged into upstream master.

- [master](https://github.com/embecosm/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/tree/master): 134b443512
- [development](https://github.com/embecosm/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/tree/development): 503712d564

Embecosm patch #1 v. master.
- no significant impact: `strcat`, `strchr`, `strcmp`, `strcpy`
- improvement: `memchr`, `memcmp`, `memcpy`, `memmove`, `memset`, `strncat`, `strncpy`, `strnlen`
- no data: `strlen`, `strncmp`

## Actions

2024-11-13:
- Paolo Savini to investigate whether patch #1 may cause exceptions to be taken at the wrong byte address, thereby causing a failure on resumption.
- Paolo Savini to investigate whether patch #2 can use larger `memcpy` than Max and therefore may offer further improvements
- Jeremy Bennett to redo the SiFive benchmark scripts without any plugins enabled and to report just total execution time when comparing.

## Other

Paolo Savini and Jeremy Bennett are both away traveling on 20 November, so the meeting on this date is cancelled.  Our next meeting will therefore be on 27 November.
