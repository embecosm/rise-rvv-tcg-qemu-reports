# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-11-13

## Milestone 2

Make requested revisions to Paolo's upstream patches:
- COMPLETE.
- first patch submitted with changes recommended by Daniel Barboza, awaiting merge.
- second patch made obsolete by merge of Max's V6 patch:
  - this incorporates the use of memcpy; and
  - we have asked for clarification from Richard Henderson of why atomicity matters for the memcpy call.

SiFive benchmarks:
- COMPLETE.
- the two failing benchmarks (`strlen` and `strncmp`) are confirmed to also fail with VLEN=256 and LMUL=8 on BananaPi F3. They generate an illegal instruction exception, just as they do on QEMU.
```
bianbu@k1:~/rise-tests$ ./benchmark-strlen.exe 1 1
Illegal instruction
bianbu@k1:~/rise-tests$ ./benchmark-strncmp.exe 1 1
Illegal instruction
bianbu@k1:~/rise-tests$ ./benchmark-memcpy.exe 1 1
bianbu@k1:~/rise-tests$ 
```

## Other

Paolo Savini and Jeremy Bennett are both away traveling on 20 November, so we propose canceling this meeting.  Our next meeting will therefore be on 27 November.
