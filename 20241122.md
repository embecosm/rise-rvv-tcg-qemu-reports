# RISE RP005 QEMU interim report 2024-11-22

We have had no meeting this week, due to vacations and travel. This is a
report on progress at the end of the week.

## Milestone 2

Make requested revisions to Paolo's upstream patches:
- REOPENED.
- the first patch had been awaiting merge.  However, Max has posted his concern about exceptions during the load/store leading to an invalid value in the `vstart` CSR (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-11/msg03037.html)).  This is under investigation.
- on the second patch, Richard Henderson has clarified that atomicity is a concern because we must not accept an interrupt in the middle of storing an element, which could happy with `memcpy` because of it being byte oriented (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-11/msg03111.html)).  We may have a solution, which we are exploring. This will be a new patch, because the existing patch is now incompatible with upstream.

SiFive benchmarks:
- COMPLETE
- LMUL is fixed to the value in the benchmark
- benchmarks are timed using QEMU built with plugins disabled.
- results are shown as times for one million iterations

## Milestone 3

Generate TCG Ops for vector load/store
- IN PROGRESS.

Improve first-fault handling for vector load/store helper functions.
- IN PROGRESS.

Improve strided load/store helper functions.
- IN PROGRESS.

## Statistics

### SiFive benchmarks

See [report-2024-11-22-20-00-58.pdf](./strmem-reports/report-2024-11-22-20-00-58.pdf). Commits in branches of the
[rise-rvv-tcg-qemu](https://github.com/embecosm/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu) repository:
- [master](https://github.com/embecosm/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/tree/master): 134b443512
- [development](https://github.com/embecosm/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/tree/development): 503712d564 (Embecosm patch #1)

Embecosm patch #1 v. master.
- no significant impact: `memchr`, `strcat`, `strchr`, `strcmp`, `strcpy`, `strlen`
- improvement for small data: `memcmp`, `memcpy`, `memmove`, `memset`
- improvement for large data: `strncat`, `strncmp`, `strncpy`, `strnlen`
- improvement for all data: _None_

## Actions

2024-11-13:
- Paolo Savini to investigate whether patch #1 may cause exceptions to be taken at the wrong byte address, thereby causing a failure on resumption.
  - IN PROGRESS
  - under investigation as described above.
- Paolo Savini to investigate whether patch #2 can use larger `memcpy` than Max and therefore may offer further improvements.
  - IN PROGRESS
  - potential solution identified - see above.
- Jeremy Bennett to redo the SiFive benchmark scripts without any plugins enabled and to report just total execution time when comparing.
  - COMPLETE

Next meeting 27 November 2024.
