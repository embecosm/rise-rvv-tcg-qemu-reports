# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2025-01-08

## Milestone 2

- Patch 1 (small vectors unit stride loads/stores) has been approved and pushed to riscv-to-apply.next.
- Patch 2 (large vectors unit stride loads/stores) is being updated to address Richard Henderson's review.
  - latest review from Richard Handerson: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-12/msg05246.html
  - a new version of this will be sumbitted upstream soon.

## Milestone 3

- A new version of the patch for the whole register loads/stores is being tested for performance and will be soon submitted upstream.
  - this new version of the patch addresses the latest review from Max Chou: https://lore.kernel.org/all/258795e9-4e97-4cd7-949f-24e88d24f25e@sifive.com/

## Milestone 3 - patch 1 V3 details

The previous implementation consisted in calling qemu functions to perform 128 bits loads and stores in order to quickly emulate loads and store of whole vector registers.
These functions though only generate at best pair of 64-bit loads and stores in the current QEMU.
That meant that if a fault happened on the second of these memory operations we wouldn't be in the position of updating vstart from our routine in target/riscv/insn_trans.

The new version of the patch calls directly for the generation of 64 bit loads and stores in order to emulate.
This doens't affect particularly performance because we were generating pairs of 64-bit loads and stores anyway and it allows us to update vstart for each load and store we generate.
The new version also address the possibility that the machine we run on has 32 bit registers and calls for 32 bit loads and stores in that case.
If the vector element are 64-bit long we fall back to using the helper function so that we avoid loading and storing half vector elements, exposing thus ourselves to the risk of being surprised by a fault mid-element.

## Milestone 3

Generate TCG Ops for vector whole word load/store.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- We have updated the patch to address the latest review: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-12/msg05246.html.
  - once the performance is tested against regressions we'll submit the patch upstream.

Improve first-fault handling for vector load/store helper functions.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- No new work to report this week.

Improve strided load/store helper functions.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- No new work to report this week.
