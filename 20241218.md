# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-12-18

This will the last report for 2024.

## Milestone 2

Make requested revisions to Paolo's upstream patches.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- This work is now being handled by Craig Blackmore.
- Following a question by Max Chou we have carried out detailed statistical analysis to verify that the new optimization is always beneficial and have slightly adjusted thresholds to particularly tune for `memcpy`.  This is now posted upstream (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-12/msg04433.html)).  See the detailed discussion below.
- The second patch was posted a week ago requesting comments, but none have yet been received.  The patch has been reposted to allow it to be reviewed for merge (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-12/msg04436.html)).

SiFive benchmarks.
- **COMPLETE**.

### Patch 1 details

This is a patch which only benefits small loads and stores - it is disabled for larger loads and stores.  As such it complements Max Chou's earlier patch, which benefits larger loads and stores.  Max Chou raised a question on the revised first patch about whether it could slow down `memcpy` for larger data sizes (see [this mailing list post](https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-12/msg02276.html)).  We carried out extensive benchmarking and statistical analysis on a number of machines.  The three points which became apparent were:

- the cut off point for using data sizes this optimization varies (in the range 6-10) depending on VLEN and the specific host platform being used;
- the speedup gained varies (in the range 30-60%) depending on the host platform being used.
- there is no statistically significant impact on performance for larger data sizes.

The comparison was using

The following graphs show the result of carrying out 6 full performance runs for `memcpy` using single threaded execution.  The host was an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v4 @ 2.20GHz.

The variation with change of processor can be seen from the following graphs.  These are 15 short performance runs for `memcpy` using single threaded executions.  The host was an AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS.

## Milestone 3

Generate TCG Ops for vector whole word load/store.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- We have updated the patch from last week to ensure `vstart` is correctly
  handled.  The patch can be found in [this mailing list post](https://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-12/msg04537.html).  The patch is particularly beneficial for large copies with small VLEN, yielding up to 10x speedup.

Improve first-fault handling for vector load/store helper functions.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- No new work to report this week.

Improve strided load/store helper functions.
- **IN PROGRESS**.
- No new work to report this week.

## Statistics

### SiFive benchmarks: Patch 1 comparison

There is no new general benchmark run this week.  However the statistical analysis above reports detailed results for `memcpy` and the latest version of the patch.

### SiFive benchmarks: TCGOp generation for memcpy (modified)

This uses a reimplementation of the `memcpy` benchmark using whole word load/store.  The source is in this [GitHub fork of sifive-libc](https://github.com/jeremybennett/sifive-libc/blob/jpb-whole-word-ldst/src/memcpy_vext.S).  Since this is the only benchmark which will benefit from this optimization, we run the benchmark just for `memcpy`.

- Baseline commit: [8032c78e55](https://github.com/PaoloS02/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/commit/8032c78e556cd0baec111740a6c636863f9bd7c8)
- Patch commit: [662f602a62](https://github.com/PaoloS02/rise-rvv-tcg-qemu/commit/662f602a62346666285d50f24bc4e5a499827e91)
- See [report-2024-12-19-13-42-32.pdf](./strmem-reports/report-2024-12-19-13-42-32.pdf).

Not surprisingly we see particular benefit for copies that will not fit in a single vector register.  The speedup (up to 10x) is most pronounced for small vectors.  This reflects the current helper function implementation being most effective for large vector registers.
