# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-10-30

Version 4 of the patches is upstream.

## Work completed since last report

- Upstream fixes for the latest feedback.
    - Pushed a new version of the patches (v4).
    - V5 might be needed to find an alternative way to generate atomic memory operations.
    - No issues found with patch 1 of the patch set (small vectors).

- Start optimization for whole register load/store operations through tcg op generation.
    - nothing to report yet.
    - we're looking into adding resources to speed up the work.

- Investigate the SIGILL QEMU error in the SiFive library functions
    - the error might be due a bad combination of LMUL and VLEN with some instructions (thanks Nathan for suggesting).
    - Jeremy has been improving the scripts and aims at having the issue resolved by the end of the month.

- Actions:
    - Paolo to update the slides for the RISC-V Summit.
        - COMPLETE.

## Work planned for the coming week

    - Address any new comments on patch 2 (it might not need new implementations, just a better description).
