# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-09-25

## Work completed since last report

[SiFive function performance report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kr5vCa75Bdy9MtF781KLEplOXlOxbwwL).

- WP2
  - Scripts to automate the SiFive library functions are available.
	- example automated report above
	- currently just the 5 memory functions, 9 string functions to be added
      shortly.
    - large speedups for `memcpy`, `memmove` and `memset` (up to 79x), modest
      for `memcmp` (up to 6.7x), small for `memchr` (few percent).
	- run takes < 20 minutes

- Other
  - Work in progress reviewing Max's draft of the RV Summit talk.

## Work planned for the coming week

- WP2
  - Complete SiFive library function set
  - Single instruction benchmarking relevant to SiFive library functions
  - Resume work on AArch64 comparison.

## Changes since start of project

It is useful to keep an idea of what we have achieved since 1 May 2024. We use ns/instruction as our metric.

| Metric                  | Start |  Now | Speedup | Notes        |
|:------------------------|------:|-----:|--------:|:-------------|
| `memcpy` worst case     |       |      |      2% |              |
| `memcpy` best case      |       |      |  6,869% |              |
| SPEC CPU 2017 average   |  13.3 | 11.3 |     15% |              |
| SPEC CPU 2017 best case |  12.0 |  7.4 |     38% | `628.pop2_s` |

Percentage changes relative to "now".  SPEC CPU 2017 results are from August, since we have stopped measuring this.
