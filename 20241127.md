# RISE RP005 QEMU weekly report 2024-11-27

## Milestone 2

Make requested revisions to Paolo's upstream patches:
- REOPENED.
- this work is now being handled by Craig Blackmore
- the first patch had been awaiting merge.  We are investigating whether an exception  during the load/store could lead to an invalid value in the `vstart` CSR (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-11/msg03037.html)).
- for the second patch, we are exploring a possible solution to ensure that interrupts are not taken in the middle of an elements during `memcpy`. (see [this mailing list post](https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-11/msg03111.html)). We anticipate this will be a new patch, since the current patch is incompatible with upstream.

SiFive benchmarks:
- COMPLETE

## Milestone 3

Generate TCG Ops for vector load/store
- IN PROGRESS.
- We have a preliminary solution, but it is not yet working as intended. We have asked Daniel Barboza to review the code for suggestions.

Improve first-fault handling for vector load/store helper functions.
- IN PROGRESS.

Improve strided load/store helper functions.
- IN PROGRESS.

## Statistics

### SiFive benchmarks

There are no new statistics to report since our last report.

## Actions

2024-11-13:
- Craig Blackmore (transferred from Paolo Savini) to investigate whether patch #1 may cause exceptions to be taken at the wrong byte address, thereby causing a failure on resumption.
  - ONGOING
  - under investigation as described above.
- Craig Blackmore (transferred from Paolo Savini) to investigate whether patch #2 can use larger `memcpy` than Max and therefore may offer further improvements.
  - ONGOING
  - potential solution identified - see above.
- Jeremy Bennett to redo the SiFive benchmark scripts without any plugins enabled and to report just total execution time when comparing.
  - COMPLETE

Next meeting 4 December 2024.
